      <h4>Share the Mission</h4>
      <p>Talk about The Fair Play Collective. Share our story, manifesto, and vision with others who believe games can be better — for developers and players alike.</p>

      <h4>Give Feedback</h4>
      <p>We’re building this from the ground up and your ideas matter. What do you want this to be? What would make you proud to support it? Reach out and let us know.</p>

      <h4>Join the Team</h4>
      <p>We’re looking for folks with experience in:</p>

        <li>Community building</li>
        <li>Legal & nonprofit advisory</li>
        <li>Ethical fundraising and operations</li>
