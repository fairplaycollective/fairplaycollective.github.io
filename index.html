      <h2>🚧 This Is Just the Beginning</h2>
      <p>We’re not launching a product — we’re starting a movement.</p>
      <p>The Fair Play Collective is in its earliest days, and we’re inviting creators, collaborators, and believers in fair, sustainable game development to help shape it from the ground up.</p>
      <p>Whether you're a developer, backer, or just curious — you're here at the start.</p>
      <p><strong>Let’s build it right.</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>🧭 Mission</h3>
      <p>We believe great games are made by people — not publishers.</p>
      <p>The Fair Play Collective is a community-funded initiative supporting small studios with the time, funding, and freedom to make bold games on their terms. No layoffs, no crunch, no corporate compromise.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>📜 Manifesto</h3>
      <p>Our manifesto outlines what we stand for — from how we support studios to the values that shape our community.</p>

      <h3>🧠 Creative Ethics & AI Policy</h3>
      <p>While I (Dylan) am using AI to help with administrative tasks like outlining or formatting, creative work must come from real humans, with real credit and real pay. This includes everything else as soon as we get more humans involved with the project.</p>
      <p><strong>But we stand firmly against its use in the creative work we support.</strong></p>
      <p>No AI-generated:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🎨 Artwork</li>
        <li>✍️ Writing</li>
        <li>🎮 Code</li>
        <li>🧑‍⚖️ Legal language</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Human creators. Real credit. Transparent pay. Always.</strong></p>
