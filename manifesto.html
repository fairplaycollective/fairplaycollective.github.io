      <h2>🎮 The Fair Play Collective Manifesto</h2>
      <p>A new model for making games, together.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>🎯 Why We Exist</h3>
      <p>The games industry is broken.</p>
      <p>Publishers are laying off thousands. Studios are shuttering mid-project. Creative people are burning out or burning out of the industry entirely.</p>
      <p>We believe a better system is possible — one rooted in community support, creative freedom, and transparent, stable funding. One that treats games as art, labor as sacred, and players as partners — not customers to be squeezed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>🛠 What We’re Building</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Multi-year funding to make the games they believe in</li>
        <li>Living wages, with public transparency</li>
        <li>No creative interference, marketing mandates, or early access pressure</li>
        <li>A shared space for accountability, support, and autonomy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This isn’t a publisher. This isn’t a crowdfunder. It’s a mutual aid system for devs — funded by people who believe games are worth making even when they’re not mass-market hits.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>📜 What We Stand For</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Creative sovereignty:</strong> Devs make what they want. No pitch wars. No popularity contests. No interference.</li>
        <li><strong>Worker-first ethics:</strong> No layoffs. No crunch. No hidden pay scales. Studios must submit fair, public compensation plans and timelines.</li>
        <li><strong>Trust, not access:</strong> Backers don’t get early builds. They fund because they believe — not because they want to peek behind the curtain.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency everywhere:</strong> Salaries, progress, and project status are shared publicly. No NDAs. No smoke and mirrors.</li>
        <li><strong>Community without control:</strong> Supporters get behind-the-scenes access when studios choose to share — but never creative ownership or decision-making power.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>⚙️ How It Works (Right Now)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Monthly Backers Fund the Pool:</strong> Supporters pay a flat monthly rate. We publish monthly reports showing how it's used.</li>
        <li><strong>Studios Apply for Funding:</strong> They submit a concept, timeline, staffing, salaries, and a no-layoff/crunch pledge. A developer-led board reviews each one.</li>
        <li><strong>Selected Studios Receive Monthly Support:</strong> Up to 24 months of funding with progress reporting and accountability.</li>
        <li><strong>Games Are Released When They’re Ready:</strong> No early access. No forced deadlines. Devs set the timeline.</li>
        <li><strong>Backers Get Benefits:</strong> Free monthly game, discounts, updates, and transparency reports.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>🎁 Backer Benefits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Monthly free game (yours to keep, no DRM)</li>
        <li>40% off MSRP on all Collective games</li>
        <li>Dev diaries, postmortems, AMAs and live Q&As</li>
        <li>Founding member credit on site and in-game</li>
        <li>More to come in this space</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>⚖️ Accountability & Zero Tolerance</h3>
      <p>We’re building this collective because the industry has failed to protect its people — especially from exploitation, abuse, and silence.</p>
      <p>That means enforceable expectations and zero tolerance for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Misuse of funds</li>
        <li>Sexual harassment or misconduct</li>
        <li>Bullying, threats, or verbal abuse</li>
        <li>Discrimination or hate speech</li>
        <li>Physical violence or intimidation</li>
        <li>Forced/coerced crunch</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Violations trigger a confidential investigation. If substantiated:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Funding is suspended</li>
        <li>Public accountability report is issued</li>
        <li>Studios may be permanently removed</li>
        <li>Offenders are named; studios that protect them lose support</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not shield abusers. We do not quietly cut ties. We take action.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>✊ Join Us</h3>
      <p>This is an experiment in trust, mutual respect, and building a future for games based on care, transparency, and freedom — not survival.</p>
      <p>If you believe in that future — you’re already one of us.</p>
