      <h2>Dylan Smith</h2>
      <p><em>IT Professional &middot; Game Industry Veteran &middot; Founder, The Fair Play Collective</em></p>

      <p>Hi, I’m Dylan.</p>

      <p>I spent nearly a decade in the game industry, working behind the scenes as an IT lead at one of the biggest studios in the world. I wasn’t a game dev, but I worked every day alongside the people who make games possible &mdash; solving problems, supporting teams, and helping others thrive.</p>

      <p>And then I got laid off.</p>

      <p>So many talented people have been let go in the last few years. Studios closed. Projects scrapped. And behind the headlines: real lives upended. It’s disheartening &mdash; especially when you love this industry and the medium.</p>

      <p>But instead of just watching it burn, I’m trying something different.</p>

      <p>The Fair Play Collective isn’t a company (yet). It’s not a nonprofit (yet). Right now, it’s just an idea &mdash; a seed &mdash; that says maybe there’s a better way to support game development: one based on sustainability, transparency, and human-centered values.</p>

      <p><strong>I'm just one guy starting something that feels right.</strong></p>

      <p>If that resonates with you, I’d love to <a href="contact.html">talk</a>.</p>
