                    <h3>üè° What is The Fair Play Collective?</h3>
                    <p>The Fair Play Collective is a new way of getting games made. We pair a community that wants to support small studios with teams that are making cool games and provide predictable, sustainable funding for those teams. Together, we're building a better games industry with no crunch, no layoffs, and creative freedom for the teams making the games.</p>

                    <div class="comparison-list">
                        <p>Together, backers are funding a fair, living wage for small studios and solo developers, not backing just an end project.</p>
                        <p>Devs can focus on making their game, not marketing it. The Fair Play Collective will be showcasing all teams being funded, but big marketing campaigns far in advance of the game release aren't essential to the process.</p>
                        <p>Backers are supporting a sustainable model for the games industry</p>
                        <p>Revenue sharing isn't required, and studios keep the money they make on their games.</p>
                        <p>Funding is consistent and reliable over the entire development process - not all at once.</p>
                        <p>Studios we work with are held accountable through transparency and communication requirements.</p>
                        <p>We are working together to maximize our collective impact on the industry, not just a single studio or game.</p>

                    <h3>üí∏ Where does the money go?</h3>
                    <p>The Fair Play Collective will collect contributions in order to fund small game studios for up to multi-year projects, ensuring they can get made without extra stress or crunch. Studios will receive money monthly rather than all at once, and need to be accountable for those funds by sharing:</p>
                    <ul class="accountability-list">
                        <li>Transparent budgets</li>
                        <li>Studio roadmaps reviewed by a developer board before approval</li>
                        <li>Equal pay for equal work</li>
                        <li>No layoffs during the funding period</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A small portion of funds (~10‚Äì15%) go toward FPC's operational costs, including platform maintenance and fees, review panel costs, admin work (accounting, taxes), and communications.</p>
                    <p><span class="ptpspan2">All admin and staff pay will be transparent and capped to ensure that most of our funds are going to what we all want to support - the indie studios.</span></p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do you define fair pay?</h3>
                    <p>Great question! This is obviously complex, and has many different factors that come into play. We'll be looking at the roles involved, location, and cost of living to ensure studios are engaging in fair pay. Any freelancers must also be paid equitably. Studio budgets will be reviewed by the board before projects are approved.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What happens if a studio gets a publisher?</h3>
                    <p>That's great! We want to see games get made and get out there in the world. We will review with our studios to see if they still require support from the Fair Play Collective to ensure their games do get finished. If studios leave the program, their work is theirs and they can continue the project; we don't own their work.</p>

                    <p><strong>No.</strong> While we think you'll enjoy many of the projects made, not every game is for every person. We want to ensure that developers are empowered in making the games they want to make. Who knows - you might just get a new favorite you would have never expected!</p>
                    <p>To ensure fairness and equal access to opportunity, a board of experienced devs, producers, and project managers will assess project viability and suitability before approval. Backers are supporting a new way of getting games made, not individual games.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What about backers? Can we get to know the devs?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely! The games industry is filled with so many awesome, interesting, and funny people, and we want to celebrate them. Some of the things we're considering are:</p>
                    <ul class="community-features">

                    <p>We will review any proposals containing AI inputs on a case-by-case basis. We recognize that tools may support work-life balance, but should not replace human labor.</p>
