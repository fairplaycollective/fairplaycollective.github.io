      <p>Everything we can answer right now, and what we're still working on.</p>

      <h3>🏡 What is The Fair Play Collective?</h3>
      <p>The Fair Play Collective is a community-funded initiative to support independent game studios with long-term, sustainable funding — outside the traditional publisher model. We believe in fair pay, no crunch, and total creative freedom.</p>
      <p>We’re in the early days. Right now, it’s a manifesto, a mission, and a growing network of people who want to make games better.</p>

      <h3>💸 Where does the money go?</h3>
      <p>Backer contributions go directly toward funding small game studios for multi-year development timelines. Studios are funded monthly rather than all at once, and we require:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Transparent budgets</li>
        <li>Equal pay for equal work</li>
        <li>No layoffs during the funding period</li>
        <li>Studio roadmaps reviewed by a developer board before approval</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A small portion of funds (~10–15%) go toward operational costs — including admin work, project reviews, communications, and platform maintenance. All admin pay will be transparently published and capped.</p>

      <h3>🎮 What do backers get?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>40% off MSRP for all games released while subscribed</li>
        <li>One rotating free game/month from the library (once games begin)</li>
        <li>Founding Member credit in funded games</li>
        <li>Monthly dev diaries, behind-the-scenes content, and updates</li>
        <li>Opportunities to help shape policy and direction</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>⌛ What do I get if I back early, before any games launch?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Founding status in the Collective</li>
        <li>Locked-in pricing and perks when games launch</li>
        <li>Early access to content and studio updates</li>
        <li>Direct involvement in shaping our growth</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>You’re not backing a product — you’re backing a movement.</strong></p>

      <h3>🧠 Do backers vote on what games get made?</h3>
      <p>No. We believe in developer-led creativity, not popularity contests. A board of experienced devs, producers, and PMs assesses project viability and ethics before approval. Backers support the ecosystem — not just one title.</p>

      <h3>🔒 Will developers be forced to release demos or early builds?</h3>
      <p>No. We’re not an Early Access platform. Studios share what they want — dev diaries, art, blogs, etc. — but 1.0 is up to them.</p>

      <h3>🧠 What’s the Collective’s policy on AI-generated content?</h3>
      <p>We do not permit AI-generated content in any games we fund:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No AI-generated writing or dialog</li>
        <li>No AI-generated artwork, textures, or animation</li>
        <li>No AI-generated code or sound</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While Dylan uses AI for admin tasks (like formatting this FAQ), creative work must come from real humans with real credit and real pay.</p>

      <h3>⚖️ What if a studio breaks the rules?</h3>
      <p>We have a Zero Tolerance Accountability Policy. If a studio misuses funds or violates ethics (e.g., crunch, harassment), they’re removed and publicly listed. Transparency builds trust.</p>

      <h3>🌱 Who is building this?</h3>
      <p>Right now? Just one guy — Dylan. Former IT at Epic Games, now trying to build something better. Want to help? <a href="contact.html">Reach out</a>.</p>
