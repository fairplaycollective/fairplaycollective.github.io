            </br>
			<p><span class="purpleSpan">The games industry, in its current form, is not sustainable.</span></p>
            <p>You’ve all heard the stories of mass layoffs at your favorite studios - both when a project is going poorly, AND when it goes incredibly well. The crunch at the end of every project. Uprooting your family every few years to chase the next job. Colleagues who burn out and go to write dental software instead.</p>
			<p>We believe a better system is possible. With stable, transparent funding, community support, and creative freedom, we can make the industry better for all the people that love it. We believe games are an art form, players can and should be invested partners, and people are the games industry’s greatest resource.</p>

		<div class = "home-text-element-light" id="building" style="text-align: justify">
		   <h2 class="linerPink2"> <span class="ptpspan2"><strong>What We're Building</strong></span></p></h1>
            </br>
            <p><span class="ptpspan2">We want to provide:</span></p>
            <p>• Stable multi-year funding so studios can make the games they want to make, without crunching or cutting corners</p>
            <p>• Livable wages, with transparency and predictability</p>
            <p>• Creative freedom, with less pressure to demo to execs or launch early access before it’s ready </p>
            <p>• A community for indie devs to support and learn from one another</p>
            <p>We’re not a publisher, or a crowdfunder. We want to build a mutual aid system for indie developers - funded by people who are excited to try new things and find those hidden gem games.

           </br>
            <p><strong>Creative Sovereignty:<br> </strong>Devs are empowered to make the games they’re passionate about. We don’t aim to accept only the games we think will be successful commercially, but games that push the boundaries, tell meaningful stories, or make us think.
</p>            
            <p><strong>Worker-First Ethics: </strong><br>Studios we work with commit to no crunch and no layoffs, as well as sharing their compensation plans and timelines to ensure that game devs have safe, sane conditions to work in.
            <p><strong>Trust, Not Access:</strong><br>Teams can choose what they share early - whether that’s the tiniest teaser image, a full demo, or nothing at all. Backers fund projects because they want to help and want to play cool games (when they’re done!).
            <p><strong>Transparency Everywhere: </strong><br>Studios share timelines and project status publicly, as well as salary information. Devs aren’t forced to sign NDAs that keep their work behind a curtain.  
            <p><strong">Community Without Control: </strong><br>Studios can share what they want with the community, and can take feedback if they wish, but aren’t forced to change course if they don’t believe it’s the right choice.

           </br>
            <p><span class="ptpspan4">Monthly Backers Fund the Pool: </span> Supporters choose a tier and pay a monthly subscription fee. Updated information about where the money is going is available every month. 
</p>            
            <p><span class="ptpspan4">Studios Apply for Funding: </span>Studios put together a plan for the creative direction and production of their game, including timelines, staffing, and salaries. They must also agree to the no-layoff / no-crunch pledge. These are reviewed by a developer-led board.
            <p><span class="ptpspan4">Selected Studios Receive Monthly Support: </span>Studios that are selected can receive up to 24 months of funding. Studios need to maintain accountability with monthly progress reports.
            <p><span class="ptpspan4">Games Are Released When They’re Ready: </span>Teams can decide the timelines that work for them, without the pressure of external deadlines or early access releases (unless they want to!)
            <p><span class="ptpspan4">Backers Get Benefits: </span>Backers get a free game every month, discounts on new games, and updates and transparency reports from studios we’re working with. Most of all, they get the knowledge that they're creating a space for developers to make great games.
